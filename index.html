            <h1><u>Great Wall of China</u></h1>
        </dt>
        <dd>Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall
            of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, however,
            claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two
            millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy
            stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall,
            however, was its effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely
            failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political
            propaganda.”
            <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng,
                literally "ten thousand li wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
                northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic
                groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with
                selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of
                the Qin wall remains.Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
                border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
                imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and
                the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great
                Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling
                capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also
                served as a transportation corridor.

                The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from
                Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to
                Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe;
                spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
                generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.


            </p>
            <p>The Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century, and following the Ming
                army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over
                the Mongol tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire.
                The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern
                border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the
                desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.

                Unlike the earlier fortifications, the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use
                of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth. Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been
                constructed on the wall. As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years, the Ming devoted
                considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were
                especially strong.Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall, faced
                sections of the ram-earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to
                Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders. During the 1440s–1460s, the Ming also built a
                so-called "Liaodong Wall". Similar in function to the Great Wall (whose extension, in a sense, it was),
                but more basic in construction, the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong
                province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurchen-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and
                the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north. While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong
                Wall, most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.

                Towards the end of the Ming, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that
                began around 1600. Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified
                Shanhai Pass, preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally
                able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun
                dynasty. Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time
                it was for conquest. The gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general, Wu
                Sangui, who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from
                Beijing.[35] The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and eventually defeated both the Shun dynasty and the
                remaining Ming resistance, consolidating the rule of the Qing dynasty over all of China proper.</p>

            <h1>Chichén Itzá</h1>
        </dt>
        <dd>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th
            centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important
            monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”),
            which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the
            structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and
            autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent
            slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was not all work and
            science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas.
            On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
            <p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic
                period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.

                Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900)
                through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
                900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
                Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican
                styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central
                Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the
                result of cultural diffusion.

                Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great
                cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most
                diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of
                architectural styles at the site.

                The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's
                Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land
                under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of
                Yucatán.

                Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in
                2017.</p>
            <p>The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from chi',
                meaning "mouth" or "edge", and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage
                group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation
                for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water," from its (itz), "sorcerer", and ha,
                "water".

                The name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages
                to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the
                Maya orthography, Chichʼen Itzaʼ (pronounced [tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ]). This form preserves the phonemic
                distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya)
                begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. The word "Itzaʼ" has a high tone on the "a"
                followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).[citation needed]

                Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of
                the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is
                considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define
                because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc
                Yabnal ("Seven Great House"), Uuc Hab Nal ("Seven Bushy Places"), Uucyabnal ("Seven Great
                Rulers") or Uc Abnal ("Seven Lines of Abnal"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is
                recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.</p>

            <h1>Petra</h1>
        </dt>
        <dd>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and
            cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the
            Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an important
            trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs
            into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system
            that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. The
            city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more
            difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered in
            1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many questions remain about
            the city.
            <p>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō,[3][4] is an historic and archaeological
                city in
                southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
                forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[5] The
                area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[6] and the Nabataeans might have settled
                in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological
                work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC by
                which time Petra had become their capital.The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's
                proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their
                wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were
                able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly
                skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD,
                when its Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was
                constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.

                Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was
                only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed
                it as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an
                earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era several Christian churches were built,
                but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of
                nomads. It remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

                Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly
                to the Khazneh. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the
                "Rose City" because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved. It has been a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of
                man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Al-Khazneh was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.
                Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked
                at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.
                Tourism in the city was crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again,
                reaching 260,000 visitors in 2021.</p>
